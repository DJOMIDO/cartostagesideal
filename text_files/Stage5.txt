 # Exploiting the structure of HTML to learn document representations

## Context
Information Retrieval (IR) models aim at predicting which documents within a potentially huge collection are relevant to a given user information need (usually a query). Current models of Information
Retrieval, like in many other fields, are nowadays based on transformer architectures.

More precisely, two types of model are now prevalent: (1) representation-based techniques, where the document and the query representations are computed separately (dense or sparse vector) before using a matching scoring function (e.g. inner product); (2) interaction-based techniques, where both the query and the document content are used to compute a relevance score.

Current research focuses on how to (pre)train the models and the problem of modeling the task better, i.e., how to compute the representation of the document and/or the query, or of both the query and document. Improving the quality of the representation is key to building successful (transformer) models for IR, as shown in the best-performing models to date [Gao and Callan, 2021].

## Objectives
The internship will explore new ways to compute the representation of (Web) documents, by considering various aspects of Web documents, i.e.
both their internal (DOM) and external (links) structure in the context of Information Retrieval.

In the context of Web search, when dealing with web pages, the Document
Object Model (DOM) tree represents the document's structure [Gupta et al., 2003].  Recent work on transformer-based models shows that this structure can be encoded explicitly [Ainslie et al., 2020] or implicitly [Aghajanyan et al., 2021] in the model. One recent approach [Guo et al., 2022] proposes to separate the encoding of the text content from the node structure, before using both representations as a basis for dense ranking.

The goals of this internship will be to study how the HTML structure can be leveraged to (1) build better document representations by exploiting the inner HTML structure and/or the hyperlinks between the documents; and (2) provide a better pre-training (i.e. without the supervision of query paired with relevant documents).

The intern is encouraged to develop their own ideas, and to publish in (inter)national venues and/or to participate in international evaluation campaigns (such as TREC).

Organization
The internship will take place at the Qwant offices with visits to ISIR
(remote work is also possible). The internship is supervised by
Benjamin Piwowarski from ISIR, and Lara Perinetti and Romain Deveaud from Qwant.

The intern will potentially work with the following tools/technologies:
-   Deep Learning libraries (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jax/Flax, Huggingface
    ecosystem, etc.)
-   Python
-   Search engine tools (https://github.com/vespa-engine/pyvespa)
-   Git version control
-   Jupyter Environment

Qwant will provide the intern a laptop and access to a remote compute server with GPU capabilities.

Candidates can send their questions, as well as their resumes + motivation (a few lines) to l.perinetti@qwant.com, r.deveaud@qwant.com and benjamin@piwowarski.fr
